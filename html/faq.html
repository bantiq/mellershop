            <div class="faq__question-text">The skinner is a separate independent item of clothing. Once you put on the
                skinner, there is a chance that you will forget how to wear pants and T-shirts. It can be worn both on
                the naked body and over clothes, including wearing it on pants or shorts (there are "pockets-holes" in
                the skinner that allow you to easily reach the pockets of your pants). The peel is combined with
                outerwear in the cold season, with accessories, bags, hats, helmets and anything. It all depends on your
                creativity.</div>
